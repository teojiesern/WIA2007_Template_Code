This is the directory that one specific app has access to, which is the app that the app specific storage belongs to. It can exists in both internal and external storage but just bear in mind that the content inside it, no other apps can have access to it. Imagine a folder that is named my-app, internally there might be a lot of other subfolders which consist of confidential information specifically for that app. By default it is saved in internal storage but if we connect any external storage, the app specific storage would also exist in external storage as well
