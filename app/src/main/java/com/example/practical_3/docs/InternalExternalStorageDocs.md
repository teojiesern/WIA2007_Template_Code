This is a very easy concept, just made confusing when introduced together with app specific storage and shared storage. Essentially internal and external does not have anything to do with them, it simply means

-   Internal storage meant the device’s internal memory. Files stored here were locked to your app, meaning that other apps couldn’t access them regardless of their permissions.
-   External storage meant anything that wasn’t the device’s internal memory, such as an inserted SD card. This was used as a free-for-all location that any app could access, so long as that app had the right permissions.
