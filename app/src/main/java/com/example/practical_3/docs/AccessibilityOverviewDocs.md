# Honors Individuals

Universal default experiences rarely meet everyoneâ€™s needs. Introducing customizable features in a default experience allows room for individual adaptation. Honoring the shifting needs of any person can mean giving more freedom to choose things for themselves

Because a person's experience throughout their day, or year, or life can continue to change, it helps to support varying preferences and choices that allow individuals to address how their changing conditions, individual knowledge, and varying needs are met.

# Learn Before not after

Before defining solutions, invest time in understanding the needs of users with a wide range of abilities and life experiences. Formal and informal research can open new ways of thinking, reduce biases, and encourage creative ways to make access available, especially to those who fall outside prevailing norms.

Accessible design processes anticipate as many potential product or experience outcomes as possible upfront. When design problems arise, the exploration of outcomes can be used as a research foundation for learning and recovering thoughtfully.

# Requirements as a starting point

The minimum requirements established by WCAG support specific human needs. Designing with accessibility standards is a creative opportunity to expand and improve the application of requirements that improve human relationships with technology.

History has shown that features originating from responses to specific access needs (dark mode, text-to-speech, speech-to-text) are a result of creative problem-solving within specified constraints. Seeing the requirements as opportunities, rather than constraints, has been shown to lead to solutions that ultimately serve many.
